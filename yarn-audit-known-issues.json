Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","reported_by":null,"title":"ws affected by a DoS when handling a request with many HTTP headers","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-37890"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"ws","vulnerable_versions":">=7.0.0 <7.5.10","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 7.5.10 or later","patched_versions":">=7.5.10","updated":"2024-08-05T05:02:34.000Z","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-476"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"}}}

Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230.\n\n### References\n\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/2230\n- https://github.com/websockets/ws/pull/2231\n\n[`--max-http-header-size=size`]: https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--max-http-header-sizesize\n[`maxHeaderSize`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#httpcreateserveroptions-requestlistener\n[`server.maxHeadersCount`]: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#servermaxheaderscount\n","reported_by":null,"title":"ws affected by a DoS when handling a request with many HTTP headers","metadata":null,"cves":["CVE-2024-37890"],"access":"public","severity":"high","module_name":"ws","vulnerable_versions":">=7.0.0 <7.5.10","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q","recommendation":"Upgrade to version 7.5.10 or later","patched_versions":">=7.5.10","updated":"2024-08-05T05:02:34.000Z","cvss":{"score":7.5,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H"},"cwe":["CWE-476"],"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q"}}}
